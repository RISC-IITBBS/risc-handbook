# RISC Handbook

Robotics is actively engaged in the expanding problems of new developing sectors as it strives to reach the human frontier. The new generation of robots will increasingly interact, explore, and collaborate with humans, affecting people and their lives.

The scientific endeavour of a half-century of robotic discoveries that created robotics as a contemporary scientific subject has resulted in the credible prospect of practical robots among humans. The fieldâ€™s vibrant expansion and robust growth over the previous decade has spurred our desire to innovate.
