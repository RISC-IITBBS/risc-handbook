# About Us

The Robotics and Intelligence Systems Club [RISC], IIT Bhubaneswar is a group of robotics and technology enthusiasts who explore the world of technology, learn and make projects based on Robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, Computer Simulations, etc. RISC is home to many of institutes robotics enthusiasts who spend a great chunk of their time in designing and prototyping robots which can perform any required task. RISC provides a platform for students to explore and learn about modern technology.

We also organize regular workshops to inspire students across varied technical backgrounds to develop their ideas and expose them to the wonders of robotics. We are open to anyone with a general interest in engineering and who wants to explore robotics, so feel free to get in touch with us.

The motto of this society is to encourage and guide the members to learn newer technologies and make projects through which they get experience to solve real-life problems, possibly establishing a foundation for the ones who are looking at robotics as a career.
This handbook is part of an effort to provide an organised set of learning resources to make it easy for anyone to get started with the field of robotics. 

Robotics is a highly broad field that is expanding quickly while investigating novel and unusual ideas. Our current efforts are concentrated on adding more pertinent data and resources to the handbook, which now only contains topics relating to basic robotics. Any contributions or ideas you may have that could help us enhance or add new information to the manual are welcome and appreciated. Please don't hesitate to submit a [issue] or a [PR] to the repository.
